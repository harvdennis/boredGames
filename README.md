# Bored Games

### An online board games application
*This code isn't supported anymore and probably won't work with newer versions of react/node. Potential updates may come in the future...*

## Overview
This project was made for my A-level computer science coursework. 
The code was accompanied with a report going over details of the project: [Here it is if you want to skim over it.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13aPYcoNsQYG-8OQCh5LaPsPrIc6iaBbx6NnNySfClPE/edit?usp=sharing)

Unfortunately this project is now deprecated due to updates in react and node but I do have photo's of the application.
